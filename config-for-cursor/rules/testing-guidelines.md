# Testing

- Always search for and update test files related to the files you are working on.
= If a test file does not exist, create one and ensure proper test coverage.
- When writing tests:
  - Cover both positive and negative cases.
  - Ensure critical functionality and edge cases are tested.
  - Always run tests after updating tests.
