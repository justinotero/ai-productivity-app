# Github Rules

- Interact with Github through Github MCP
- If the changes are solely created by you, prefix commits with `[AI]`
- If the changes are not solely created by you, prefix with `[AI Assisted]`
- Always ask before creating a pull request
- When creating pull requests:
  - Follow the pull request template (@file .github/pull_request_template.md)
  - Fill out all applicable sections to the best of your ability
  - Prompt the user for any missing information needed to complete the template
